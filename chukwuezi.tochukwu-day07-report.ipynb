        "\n",
        "1. **Function Parameters:**\n",
        "   - **`function`**: This parameter takes a function as its value. In the example, `my_function` is passed, which defines the mathematical expression \\(f(x) = 2x^3 + x - 5\\).\n",
        "   - **`lower_bound`**: The starting point of the range where the function will be evaluated.\n",
        "   - **`upper_bound`**: The endpoint of the range.\n",
        "   - **`num_steps`**: The number of intervals between the lower and upper bounds, determining how many times the function will be evaluated.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Step Size Calculation:**\n",
        "   - The **`step_size`** is calculated by dividing the difference between `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` by the number of steps (`num_steps`). This determines how much `x` will increment on each loop iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Looping and Evaluation:**\n",
        "   - A `while` loop iterates from `lower_bound` to `upper_bound`, calculating the function value `y` at each point `x`.\n",
        "   - The loop prints each evaluated pair `(x, y)` in a well-formatted string, showing the results of the function evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output Formatting:**\n",
        "   - The output is formatted to display the values with two decimal places for clarity and readability. The plus (`+`) sign before the numbers ensures both positive and negative signs are displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure makes it easy to understand how the function behaves over a specified range, providing clear and organized output."
